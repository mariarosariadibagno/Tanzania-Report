## Background and Context
- **5 Pension Funds:** NSSF, PSPF, PPF, LAPF, GEPF  
- **Coverage:** Only 6.5% of the workforce  
- **PSPF Deficit:** Caused by unpaid pre-1999 liabilities  
- **Systemic Issues:** Inefficiency, poor coordination, inequitable benefits  
- **2014 Harmonization Rules:** Introduced to unify parameters  
  - Accrual rate  
  - Lump-sum limit  
  - Minimum pension floor

## Key Challenges (Diagnosis)

- **Financial sustainability**: growing deficits, pre-1999 liabilities.
- **Efficiency**: fragmentation across five funds.
- **Benefit design**: excessive lump-sum withdrawals.
- **Coverage** :  exclusion of informal sector and vulnerable groups.

## The DPO Logic
- **DPO** = budget support linked to reforms
- **Prior actions**: binding reforms before disbursement.
- **Triggers** : next steps for subsequent DPOs.
- Reforms sequenced from *soft* → *hard* (institutional setup → retirement age increases).

## Pillar 4 – Expand Coverage and Inclusion

**Objective:** Extend pension protection beyond the small formal sector and reduce old-age poverty.  

| | **Reform Step** |
|--|----------------|
| **DPO-I Prior Action** | Approve policy framework for voluntary schemes targeting informal workers. |
| **DPO-II Trigger** | Pilot voluntary enrollment mechanisms via mobile payments and ID systems. |
| **DPO-III Trigger** | Expand TASAF social pension and integrate informal workers into national coverage. |
| **Outcome Indicator** | Coverage rises from 6.5% → 12% of workforce. |


## Sequencing and Political Economy

- **Short term (soft)**: Harmonization, lump-sum limit, studies.
- **Medium term**: Apply new rules, begin consolidation.
- **Long term (hard)**: Raise retirement age, finalize merger, close PSPF gap.

*“Reform success depends on government capacity, stakeholder buy-in, and managing political resistance.”*

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved fund solvency (reduced liabilities).
- Streamlined administration and better governance.
- Lifetime income protection through annuities.
- Broader and fairer coverage.

## Conclusion

**Key takeaway:**  

Pension reform in Tanzania requires balancing fiscal sustainability, political feasibility, and social equity over time.

**Open questions:**

 - How can fiscal sustainability be achieved *without undermining equity*?
 
 - Should **harmonization** precede **consolidation**, or can both move in parallel?
 
 - What are the risks of *delaying hard reforms*?
 
 - How can international actors maintain reform momentum?
